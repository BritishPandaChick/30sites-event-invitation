          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
            road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
            everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared
            at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by
            a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the
            whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
            at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
            liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
            coming when she found herself so affectionately received.</p>

            <p> She saw instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage;
            his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
            minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
            family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
            neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they
            were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
            formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s
            offers of refreshment.</p>
